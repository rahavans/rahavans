#### Hi there 👋

My name is Rahavan Sivaguganantha, and I'm a fourth year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. 

**About myself...**
- 💻 I've completed four internships in various parts of the embedded life cycle, at companies such as Nokia and ecobee
- 🔧 I'm super fascinated by and enjoy working on all things embedded!
- 📡 Currently, I'm learning about the integration of Bluetooth/BLE and Wi-Fi communication on microcontrollers
- Outside of all this, I enjoy learning about finance, watching basketball and baseball, and working out
